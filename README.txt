Problem Statement

Extend Assignment #2 to implement a product search Web Application using Spring, Hibernate technology  that lists matching products for a customer who are looking to buy T-shirts

Instead of providing input on console, users will use a web application to input. The web application must be developed using Spring MVC. Spring and Hibernate integration has to be implemented.


Input
Program should accept 4 input parameters
Colour
Size
Gender
Output Preference 

“Gender” is a String which has two possible values like ‘M’ and ‘F’. M=Male and F=Female.
“Output Preference” is a String which suggests whether the results should be sorted only by Price or by Rating or by both  Price and Rating


Expected Behavior and Output

Program should be written considering that there could be more csv files and at runtime program should load the files. Please make use of Thread which will look for any new file at particular location after some configurable time and load the provided file
Create a login Page for the application and after successful login Product Search Screen will be displayed
Search screen should have all input parameters specified in previous slides as Color, Size, Gender and output preference
Once Search is triggered after specifying the search parameters, program will display the search results from the database using hibernate
Use Spring MVC and Spring - Hibernate Integration
Spring version 3 or 4 should be used
